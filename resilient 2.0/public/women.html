            <div class="women">
                <p>In India Sati, Sabitri, Durga, Laxmi are worshipped by people treating them as goddesses where as
                    there is increasing number of violence against women. The amount of violence against women has
                    increased by many fold due to the greater exposure of women in every field of life. Women were
                    previously restricted to the four walls of the houses and after globalisation they have got the
                    chances and opportunities to stand equally in all sectors at par with male. Women are now a days cab
                    drivers and they are also the CEO of top companies.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="women">
                <p>It is a good sign that the patriarchal mind set of the society has changed to some extent but not to
                    the extent it was supposed to. It is the same mind set that restricts women to go out and work
                    making them as a tool for domestication. It is the same mind set that treats males as superior than
                    female and always try to dominate the women folk.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="women">
                <p>There are different kinds of tools that is being used by the male dominated society to prove their
                    domination over the female. Eve teasing, sexual harassment, rape, domestic violence against women
                    are these weapons used by the male to display the male superiority. This is one of the prime reason
                    violence is increasing in India and women safety is a concern in India.
                </p>
            </div>
            <img class="womanimg" src="assets/women/womenimg1.png" alt="" width="700px" height="700px">

            <div class="women">
                <p class="womanp">Along with the mind set the slow pace of operation of Indian judiciary is another major reason for
                    the increasing women safety in India. The police of India is not efficient and not neutral and that
                    is the reason why the cases of violence against women takes long time in the investigation phase. In
                    the name of social pressure and shame many women did not come out and report the matter to police.
                    This is one of the many reasons why the number of cases reported are less than the actual number of
                    violence happening against women.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="women">
                <p>It is a shame that rapes take place everyday. Rape is a disease which attacks from everywhere to
                    everywhere. It is an evil that has no boundaries. It is present in every nook and corner of the
                    world. It doesn’t differentiate between a 3-year-old kid and an 80-year-old lady. From parties to
                    workplaces to our homes, rape and harassment have become a norm. The survivors of these heinous
                    crimes are then left to be humiliated throughout their life. Some of them even spend their whole
                    “after rape life” on ventilators or they are burnt alive.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="women">
                <p>In order to improve women safety in India the first task is to improve the number of women in every
                    sphere of society. Along with that the change in mind set of people is very essential for the safety
                    of women. From family to educational institutions men should be taught about respecting females.
                    Further, there should be fast-track courts to hear the cases and they cases should be investigated
                    in a time bound manner. Only strict laws can not solve the problem of women safety in India rather
                    the implementation of these laws in a time bound manner can solve the issue to a large extent.
