    <div class="middle-font">School violence prevention efforts are an important part of a
        comprehensive community safety strategy as there is a strong connection between School violence, Community
        wellbeing and Social capital. In fact School Violence is a subset of Community Crime and Violence. As a result,
        increased levels of School violence may result in increased levels of overall crime and violence in the
        community. Educators can assist the network of institutions working to identify and stop the cycle of violence.

    <div class="middle-font side-text">
        Research shows that approximately 80 percent of behaviour problems can be avoided with the effective
        implementation of primary prevention. Experience shows that School crime and violence prevention tends to be
        more successful when it is approached as a collaborative effort among School staff, Parents, Management along
        with expert NGOs. In addition to promoting achievement (an asset for healthy development), schools can provide
        an excellent environment for violence prevention programmes that have long-term effects on children and youth..
        <br><br><br><br>
        In our school climate assessment work with schools, one of the most common problems we discover is that
        bully-victim behavior is rampant and contributes to students feeling unsafe: socially, emotionally and too
        often, physically as well. There is a growing awareness that bully-victim behavior undermines students feeling
        safe in school. And, as a result it undermines their ability to learn and develop in healthy ways. It is
        important to understand the seriousness of personal safety and how to avoid dangerous situations at home or in
        school.
        <br><br>

        Hence it is necessary to have such Crime and Violence Prevention Programmes in the schools/colleges where the
        potentially delinquent youth can be identified and then can be further guided in the correct direction away from
        Crime.
